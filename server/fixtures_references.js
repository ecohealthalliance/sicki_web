    "abstract": "Exposure to cats infected with Yersinia pestis is a recently recognized risk for human plague in the US. Twenty-three cases of cat-associated human plague (5 of which were fatal) occurred in 8 western states from 1977 through 1998, which represent 7.7% of the total 297 cases reported in that period. Bites, scratches, or other contact with infectious materials while handling infected cats resulted in 17 cases of bubonic plague, 1 case of primary septicemic plague, and 5 cases of primary pneumonic plague. The 5 fatal cases were associated with misdiagnosis or delays in seeking treatment, which resulted in overwhelming infection and various manifestations of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Unlike infections acquired by flea bites, the occurrence of cat-associated human plague did not increase significantly during summer months. Plague epizootics in rodents also were observed less frequently at exposure sites for cases of cat-associated human plague than at exposure sites for other cases. The risk of cat-associated human plague is likely to increase as residential development continues in areas where plague foci exist in the western US. Enhanced awareness is needed for prompt diagnosis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "The transmission of bubonic plague from the kitten of a domestic cat to a man by means of a bite on a finger is described. The human case was complicated by the development of a secondary meningitis, followed, after specific therapy, by protracted recovery. The kitten showed swollen lymph nodes of the head and neck, frothing at the mouth and nostrils, and signs of an acute infectious disease which had a fatal termination. Yersinia pestis was isolated on about the 8th day from the cerebrospinal fluid of the man. The foster mother of the kitten exhibited signs of spinal and cerebral meningitis but recovered following treatment; her serum contained plague antibody levels of 1:512 and 1:1024 on the 22nd and 34th days respectively after the first evidence of illness. Three litter mates of the kitten also died. The outbreak occurred on a farm in the Graaff-Reinet district of the eastern Cape Province, which is situated about 160 km from the nearest known natural plague focus.",

    "volume": "413",
    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. typhi) is the aetiological agent of typhoid fever, a serious invasive bacterial disease of humans with an annual global burden of approximately 16 million cases, leading to 600,000 fatalities. Many S. enterica serovars actively invade the mucosal surface of the intestine but are normally contained in healthy individuals by the local immune defence mechanisms. However, S. typhi has evolved the ability to spread to the deeper tissues of humans, including liver, spleen and bone marrow. Here we have sequenced the 4,809,037-base pair (bp) genome of a S. typhi (CT18) that is resistant to multiple drugs, revealing the presence of hundreds of insertions and deletions compared with the Escherichia coli genome, ranging in size from single genes to large islands. Notably, the genome sequence identifies over two hundred pseudogenes, several corresponding to genes that are known to contribute to virulence in Salmonella typhimurium. This genetic degradation may contribute to the human-restricted host range for S. typhi. CT18 harbours a 218,150-bp multiple-drug-resistance incH1 plasmid (pHCM1), and a 106,516-bp cryptic plasmid (pHCM2), which shows recent common ancestry with a virulence plasmid of Yersinia pestis.",

In the 1980 to 1986 period, a total of 74 strains from patients was identified at the National Reference Centre for Salmonella, Hamburg. The clinical manifestations of the cases was not different from those associated with Y. e. O: 3 and O: 9 infections. Six out of 8 patients from whom serum samples were available, developed moderate agglutination titres (1:80-1:1280). Only 8 of the 74 strains were negative in in vitro virulence tests. A list of biochemical tests is given which permit a differentiation of the pathogenic serogroup O: 5, 27 from the apathogenic Y. e. O: 5 which is widely distributed in the environment. Serological studies revealed different H antigens in both serogroups. The O antigen factor 27, and a subfactor O: 5(2) which is typical of Y. e. serogroup O: 5, are further differential markers; the production of both factor sera is described. Besides serogroups O: 3 and O: 9, Y. e. O: 5, 27 must be considered as an aetiological agent of human yersiniosis in the Federal Republic of Germany.",

A few days later, 15 villagers suffered a severe febrile illness. Of the five individuals who had participated in the killing and dispensation of the camel, all were dead within four days. When samples of serum from nine of the remaining patients were examined, seven were found to be positive for plague as determined by the passive hemagglutination test. Another six persons became ill after killing two goats, and the serum of one goat contained antibodies to Yersinia pestis. Because all of the remaining patients except one were treated early enough, they recovered. These incidents confirm previous reports that the camel and the goat are susceptible to naturally occurring plague infection and have a significant role in the dissemination of human plague.",
