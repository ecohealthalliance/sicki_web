        "abstract": "Exposure to cats infected with Yersinia pestis is a recently recognized risk for human plague in the US. Twenty-three cases of cat-associated human plague (5 of which were fatal) occurred in 8 western states from 1977 through 1998, which represent 7.7% of the total 297 cases reported in that period. Bites, scratches, or other contact with infectious materials while handling infected cats resulted in 17 cases of bubonic plague, 1 case of primary septicemic plague, and 5 cases of primary pneumonic plague. The 5 fatal cases were associated with misdiagnosis or delays in seeking treatment, which resulted in overwhelming infection and various manifestations of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Unlike infections acquired by flea bites, the occurrence of cat-associated human plague did not increase significantly during summer months. Plague epizootics in rodents also were observed less frequently at exposure sites for cases of cat-associated human plague than at exposure sites for other cases. The risk of cat-associated human plague is likely to increase as residential development continues in areas where plague foci exist in the western US. Enhanced awareness is needed for prompt diagnosis and treatment.",

        "abstract": "The transmission of bubonic plague from the kitten of a domestic cat to a man by means of a bite on a finger is described. The human case was complicated by the development of a secondary meningitis, followed, after specific therapy, by protracted recovery. The kitten showed swollen lymph nodes of the head and neck, frothing at the mouth and nostrils, and signs of an acute infectious disease which had a fatal termination. Yersinia pestis was isolated on about the 8th day from the cerebrospinal fluid of the man. The foster mother of the kitten exhibited signs of spinal and cerebral meningitis but recovered following treatment; her serum contained plague antibody levels of 1:512 and 1:1024 on the 22nd and 34th days respectively after the first evidence of illness. Three litter mates of the kitten also died. The outbreak occurred on a farm in the Graaff-Reinet district of the eastern Cape Province, which is situated about 160 km from the nearest known natural plague focus.",
